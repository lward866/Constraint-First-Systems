# Regime-Infastructure
Regime Infrastructure documents the underlying structures that govern how systems remain stable, fail, and reorganize across scale. Rather than treating physics, engineering, biology, economics, climate, or infrastructure as isolated domains, this repository formalizes them as interconnected regime ecosystems whose behavior is determined by dominant constraints, coupling, feedback timing, and irreversibility.

The work is regime-first and constraint-driven: it prioritizes identifying which regime a system is operating in, where regime boundaries exist, and when descriptive or operational authority expires, before optimization, modeling, or intervention. The goal is not to propose solutions, designs, or policies, but to make structural limits and failure modes legible—especially in domains where misapplied assumptions propagate across layers and become irreversible.
This repository serves as a growing reference for understanding how constraint enforcement moves from abstraction to operational reality, culminating in large-scale infrastructure where delayed consequence becomes unavoidable.
